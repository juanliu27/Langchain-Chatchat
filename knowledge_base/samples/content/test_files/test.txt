# mEnrich-seq: Methylation-guided enrichment sequencing of bacterial taxa of interest from microbiome

## Introduction

<p>Microbiomes play important roles in human health, diseases, and drug responses1-3. Many studies have reported that the dysbiosis of microbiota, or the loss of microbial diversity, is not only associated with a higher risk of proliferating pathogenic microbes but is linked to many complex diseases and patients’ response to treatments4-7. In many applications, researchers hope to specifically examine certain bacterial taxa of interest in a microbiome sample, rather than sequencing all the species8-11. For example, a few enteric pathogens are of particular interest in infectious diseases10,11, while certain commensal bacteria are the target of discovery in terms of microbe-host interaction, immune homeostasis, or biosynthetic gene clusters 8,9,12.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Significant challenges arise in the sequencing of specific bacterial taxa of interest from complex microbiome samples, mostly stemming from the presence of bacterial species with complex genomes, the highly skewed abundance distribution, mixed with viruses, fungi, and mammalian cells13,14. The sequencing throughput is largely consumed by abundant microbes while low-abundant ones cannot be sequenced and studied in a cost-effective manner 15-17. Although culture can be used to isolate specific bacteria, it is time- and resource-consuming, hard to scale, and sometimes very challenging for certain bacterial taxa that are hard to culture18,19. A few technologies have been developed to address this challenge. Host genomic DNA (gDNA) can be eliminated using chemicals such as saponin to selectively lyse mammalian cells, which enables the efficient sequencing of pathogens in biospecimen that are dominated by host gDNA (e.g. upper respiratory tract infection)20,21. Host genetic material can also be filtered using DNA binding proteins that specifically recognize 5-methylcytosine (5mC), abundant in mammalian genomes22. Flow cytometry has also been used to segregate complex microbiomes into small subsets, which can be sequenced and computationally analyzed separately23. However, it is challenging for these approaches to enrich specific taxa of interest, taxa with low abundance, or resolve bacterial species and strains with highly similar genomes23. Adaptive sampling in the Nanopore platform can examine the first few hundred base pairs24, during real-time sequencing, against a collection of reference sequences and to reject the DNA molecules that meet certain criteria, e.g., host DNA or a highly abundant bacterium for which enough data have been already collected17,25,26. This strategy by adaptive sampling can reduce further consumption of sequencing yield by high abundant species; however, its enrichment efficiency for specific taxa of interest is relatively modest, and importantly insufficient to differentiate between bacterial taxa with highly similar genomes in complex microbiome samples27,28.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To address the need for effective enrichment of specific bacterial taxa of interest directly from metagenomic DNA, we developed a method taking advantage of bacterial DNA methylation in microbiomes, namely bacterial epigenome 29,30. In the bacterial kingdom, there are three major forms of DNA methylation: N6-methyladenine (6mA), N4-methylcytosine (4mC) and 5mC, which are catalyzed by methyltransferases (MTases) that apply methyl groups in a highly sequence-specific manner31, i.e., some sequence motifs are nearly 100% methylated, while most of the genome is not methylated. The bacterial methylome has three fundamental properties. First, DNA methylation is present in nearly all bacteria (&gt;95%)30,32,33. Second, all genetic contents (chromosomes, plasmids) in a single strain share the same set of methylation motifs, and most methylation sites are highly stable over time and conditions29-31, 34, 35. Third, since the presence/absence of a MTase is mainly driven by horizontal gene transfer, the methylation motifs are highly variable between different species and different strains of the same species 33,36,37. Based on these three properties, bacterial DNA methylation naturally differentiates self from non-self DNA, which serves as the foundation of restriction modification (R-M) systems, and has been exploited as natural epigenetic barcodes to group highly similar species and strains in metagenomic analyses, namely methylation binning 34,35.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>In this work, our method exploits bacterial DNA methylation motifs to differentiate bacterial taxa from each other before sequencing, to enrich bacteria of interest and deplete background DNA. The core idea is to rationally choose individual, or combinations of, methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes (REs) that digest host genome and background microbial DNA at non-methylated sequence recognition sites to eliminate the vast background of metagenomic DNA while leaving the gDNA from bacterial taxa of interest intact. This core idea is integrated with library preparation procedures in a way that only non-digested DNA libraries are sequenced, which provides an effective approach for more efficiently allocating sequencing throughput to bacterial taxa of interest. We will first describe the method design , and then provide one of the important applications to demonstrate its broad utilities in microbiome research.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Akkermansia muciniphila, a gram-negative bacterium colonizing the intestinal tract36，37, has been actively studied for its association with many human diseases such asobesity and type 2 diabetes38，39, and with patient responses to cancer immunotherapies40-42. Because A. muciniphila is strictly anaerobic with long doubling time43, it is challenging to isolate from fecal samples. RA<u>6mA</u>TTY (R = A or G; Y = C or T), mediated by a 6mA MTase, AmuORF1905P, is one of the 5 methylated motifs in A. muciniphila (ATCC-835) according to REBASE (Supplementary Fig. 1). Using comparative genomics analysis, we found that the MTase is conserved in all the 112 genomes of A. muciniphila isolates (Supplementary Table 1). &nbsp;This motivated us to apply mEnrich-seq with the RE XapI (digesting non-methylated RAATTY sites), to deplete background DNA and enrich A. muciniphila from fecal microbiome without culturing.</p>\n<p><br></p>

Briefly spin down.</p>\n<p>3) Amplify using the following cycling conditions:</p>\n<p>98°C for 1 min followed by 15-18 cycles of 98°C for 15 s, annealing 62°C for 15 s and extension at 68°C for 8 min, with a final extension at 68°C for 10 min.</p>\n<p>4) QC step</p>\n<p>- Qubit. Use 1ul of PCR product for Qubit, the concentration for an efficient PCR is ranging 10-50 ng/ul. If the concentration is low, add 2-4 more cycles.</p>\n<p>- Gel. Use another 2ul for a gel picture to check the PCR product size, correct one is around 5-10kb.</p>\n<p>5) Purify the barcoded DNA using standard methods which are suitable for the fragment size. Add 50ul NF water to the PCR product and then add 50 ul Ampure XP beads (0.5X beads).</p>\n<p>6) &nbsp;Quantify the barcoded library using standard techniques, and pool all barcoded libraries in the desired ratios in a 1.5 ml DNA LoBind Eppendorf tube.</p>\n<p>8. Library Preparation</p>\n<p>1) Sample pooling</p>\n<p>-IMPORTANT: This is the guidance for sequencing with a MinION R9.4.1 flow cell.</p>\n<p>a. Total amount for pooled library: 1000 ng</p>\n<p>b. Transfer each barcoded library with equal amount to a new tube. &nbsp;Adjust the volume to 47 ul with NF water.</p>\n<p>- If the pooled library volume is more than 47 ul, concentrate the sample with 2X beads and then elute with 47 ul NF water.</p>\n<p>2) DNA repair and end-prep</p>\n<p>a. Thaw the DNA CS (DCS) at room temperature, spin down, mix by pipetting, and place on ice.</p>\n<p>b. Prepare the NEBNext FFPE DNA Repair Mix and NEBNext Ultra II End repair / dA-tailing Module reagents in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions, and place on ice.</p>\n<p>c. In a 0.2 ml thin-walled PCR tube, mix the following:</p>\n<p>Pooled DNA library &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;47ul</p>\n<p>DNA CS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 ul</p>\n<p>Ultra II End-prep reaction buffer &nbsp;3.5 ul</p>\n<p>Ultra II End-prep enzyme mix 3 ul</p>\n<p>FFPE Repair buffer 3.5 ul</p>\n<p>FFPE Repair Mix 2 ul</p>\n<p>d. Mix gently by flicking the tube, and spin down.</p>\n<p>e. Incubate at 20°C for 15 minutes and 65°C for 15 minutes on a thermal cycler</p>\n<p>!!! Set the lid heat to 75°C.</p>\n<p>f. Add 60 μl of resuspended AMPure XP beads to the end-prep reaction and mix by flicking the tube. Incubate on a Hula mixer (rotator mixer) for 5 minutes at room temperature.</p>\n<p>g. Spin down the sample and pellet on a magnet until eluate is clear. Pipette off the supernatant without disturb the beads.</p>\n<p>h. Wash the beads with 200ul freshly prepared 80% EtOH for twice.</p>\n<p>i. Pipette off any residual ethanol. Allow to dry for ~30 seconds, but do not dry the pellet to the point of cracking.</p>\n<p>j. Resuspend the pellet in 31 μl nuclease-free water. Incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature.</p>\n<p>k. Transfer 31 μl of eluate into a clean 1.5 ml Eppendorf DNA LoBind tube.</p>\n<p>3) Adapter ligation and clean-up</p>\n<p>a. Preparation:</p>\n<p>- Spin down the Adapter Mix (AMX) and Quick T4 Ligase, and place on ice.</p>\n<p>- Thaw Ligation Buffer (LNB) at room temperature, spin down and mix by pipetting. Due to viscosity, vortexing this buffer is ineffective. Place on ice immediately after thawing and mixing.</p>\n<p>- Thaw the Elution Buffer (EB) at room temperature, mix by vortexing, spin down and place on ice.</p>\n<p>- Depending on the wash buffer (LFB or SFB) used:</p>\n<p>o To enrich for DNA fragments of 3 kb or longer, thaw one tube of Long Fragment Buffer (LFB) at room temperature, mix by vortexing, spin down and place on ice.</p>\n<p>o To retain DNA fragments of all sizes, thaw one tube of Short Fragment Buffer (SFB) at room temperature, mix by vortexing, spin down and place on ice.</p>\n<p>b. In a 1.5 ml Eppendorf DNA LoBind tube, mix in the following order:</p>\n<p>c. Mix gently by tapping/ flicking the tube, and spin down. Incubate the reaction for 30 minutes at room temperature.</p>\n<p>d. Add 40 μl of resuspended AMPure XP beads to the reaction and mix by flicking the tube. Incubate on a Hula mixer (rotator mixer) for 5 minutes at room temperature.</p>\n<p>e. Spin down the sample and pellet on a magnet until eluate is clear. Pipette off the supernatant without disturb the beads.</p>\n<p>f. Wash the beads with either 125 μl Long Fragment Buffer (LFB) or 125 μl Short Fragment Buffer (SFB) for twice. Resuspend the beads by flicking, spin down, then remove the supernatant and discard.</p>\n<p>g. Remove any residual supernatant. Allow to dry for ~30 seconds, but do not dry the pellet to the point of cracking.</p>\n<p>h. Resuspend the pellet with 7 μl Elution Buffer (EB) and incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature. For high molecular weight DNA, incubating at 37°C can improve the recovery of long fragments.</p>\n<p>i. Transfer 7 μl of eluatedDNA library into a clean 1.5 ml Eppendorf DNA LoBind tube, then take 1 ul for quantification using a Qubit fluorometer.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>9. Sequencing with ONT</p>\n<p>1) Preparation:</p>\n<p>a. Thaw the Sequencing Buffer (SQB), Loading Beads (LB), Flush Tether (FLT) and one tube of Flush Buffer (FB) at room temperature before mixing the reagents by vortexing.</p>\n<p>b. Prepare the priming mix by adding 30 ul of the thawed FLT to 1170 ul of FB, mix well.</p>\n<p>c. Insert the flow cell by slide the flow cell under the clip of the MinION device.</p>\n<p>2) Priming and loading Flow Cell</p>\n<p>a. Open the priming port by sliding the flow cell port cover clockwise.</p>\n<p>b. Draw back a small volume to remove any bubbles using a P1000 pipette.</p>\n<p>c. Load 800 μl of the priming mix into the flow cell via the priming port, avoiding the introduction of air bubbles. Incubate for 5 minutes.</p>\n<p>d. Prepare the library loading mix in a new tube during the 5min incubation:</p>\n<p>SQB &nbsp;&nbsp;37.5 ul</p>\n<p>LB, mixed immediately before use &nbsp;25.5 ul</p>\n<p>DNA library &nbsp;&nbsp;12 ul</p>\n<p>e. Lift the SpotON sample port cover, then complete the flow cell priming by adding 200 ul of the priming mix into the flow cell priming port.</p>\n<p>f. Mix the library loading mix well by gentle pipetting.</p>\n<p>g. Add the 75 ul of the library loading mix trhough the SpotON sample port in a dropwise way. Enure each drop flows into the port before adding the next drop.</p>\n<p>h. Gently cover of the SpotON sample port and slide off the priming port.</p>\n<p>3) Data collection</p>\n<p>Data acquisition is carried out by the MinKNOW software.</p>\n<p><br></p>
